All other files (hooks scripts) are copied correctly, but settings.json is missing.\n\nRoot cause: Command document says to copy the file but doesn't provide explicit instructions.\n\nFix approach:\n1.

{"id":"nc-11","title":"Fix DevRag config: documents_dir should be project root","description":"The .devrag-config.json template contains invalid fields that don't exist in DevRag, causing it to default to ./documents which doesn't exist.\n\n**Root Cause:**\nTemplate has made-up fields (indexPaths, excludePaths, chunkOverlap, updateInterval, metadata) that DevRag ignores.\n\n**DevRag Actually Supports:**\n- documents_dir: Directory containing markdown files\n- db_path: Vector database file path\n- chunk_size: Document chunk size (not chunkSize)\n- search_top_k: Number of results\n- compute: {device, fallback_to_cpu}\n- model: {name, dimensions}\n\n**Decision:**\nUse documents_dir: \".\" to index entire project root.\n\n**Why:**\n1. Want ALL scenes indexed (including drafts/archive) for comprehensive search\n2. File paths in results show status: scenes/drafts/... vs scenes/...\n3. Performance is fine: 80k novel = ~1000 chunks = 3-5MB DB, \u003c5s GPU index\n4. No need for symlinks or complex exclusions\n\n**New Template:**\n{\n  \"documents_dir\": \".\",\n  \"db_path\": \".devrag/vectors.db\",\n  \"chunk_size\": 1000,\n  \"search_top_k\": 10,\n  \"compute\": {\"device\": \"auto\", \"fallback_to_cpu\": true},\n  \"model\": {\"name\": \"multilingual-e5-small\", \"dimensions\": 384}\n}\n\n**Implementation:**\n1.
